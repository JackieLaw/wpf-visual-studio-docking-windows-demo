# Visual Studio-like Docking Windows Demo for WPF
As .NET developers, we have all worked in Visual Studio and at some point may have wondered about the docking windows that hold the Solution Explorer, Code Window, Toolbox, and others. Visual Studio-style docking windows allow you to resize, move, and change the behavior of windows to create a layout that suits various development models. The Syncfusion docking manager allows users to create their own layout by just dragging and dropping the windows to the desired positions. It also allows layouts to be persisted with built-in serialization options.
